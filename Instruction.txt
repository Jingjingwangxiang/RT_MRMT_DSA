A finite element method is used to discritized the paritial diefenrential equations. 


	Our codes are developed in object-oriented, it allows the code reusability and facilitates the implementation of reactive transport modeling. 
	To simulate the reactions, two main modules are developed. 
	The biochemical system module simulates the localized chemical reactions occurred in a (bio)chemical system, 
	it contains procedures that are capable of constructing the stoichiometric matrix and component matrix. 
	The local biochemistry module captures (bio)chemical state variables at each mesh nodes, such as components, concentrations, equilibrium reaction rates, kinetics, 
	as well as the derivatives of kinetics with respect to concentrations, etc. 
	It encapsulates procedures of chemical calculations that capable of computing the state variables at each mesh nodes by using the biochemistry system module. 
	These two main developed modules are coupled with the transport equations in the reactive transport module, which enables the modeling of reactive transport.
